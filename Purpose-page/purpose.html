				<h2>Why did I do this? </h2>
				<p> As a passionate fan of League of Legends this has been an idea of mine that I have been longing to work on for years.
					As a recently new student in computer science, I have finally found myself with the ability and tools to
					make my idea a reality. Please take this as just a suggestion and a show of appreciation for the game.</p>
				<p> But as a student, I would love to get an internship as well. So this is also my way of applying. I would love to
					work for Riot Games in game design and learn from your talented team. I have many creative ideas and a passion for
					video games as a real experience for the player. I believe I can be a strong team member and a driven student of the craft
					with the desire to work long-term. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
