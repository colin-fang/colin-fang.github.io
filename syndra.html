	<h1 id = "center">My Syndra project</h1>
	  </br>
	<p id = "center">Syndra was one of my first League of Legends mains. I fell in love with her strong laning phase and flexible kit 
	that involves the manipulation of her spheres. However I have since abandoned her due to some crippling weaknesses that she has. 
	Being an immobile mage in an environment of increasingly more mobile bruisers and assassins, her skillshots are not reliable enough 
	to keep the enemy at bay. Furthermore her ultimate skill, Unleashed Power, is very difficult to balance due to it being a point and click 
	nuke. Because of pro play, Syndra's ultimate skill is very weak and heavily diminishes her lane phase. </p>
	</br>
	<p id = "center">Throughout my time of playing the game, new mechanics have been introduced time and time again. In particular Xayah's 
	Blade Caller ability has inspired me to make my own version of Syndra's w. I have also reworked Syndra's ultimate to increase it's versatility 
	and decrease the oppressive play style.</p>
	</br>
	<p id = "center">Below is a small game that I have developed in Gamemaker Studios 2. I believe this is a good direction to take syndra, 
	helping her against mobile champions, allowing more outplay potential against her damage output and maintaining her overall identity.</p>
