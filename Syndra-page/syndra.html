			<div class = "introduction">
				<p >Syndra was one of my first League of Legends mains. I fell in love with her strong laning phase and flexible kit 
				that involves the manipulation of her spheres. However I have since abandoned her due to some crippling weaknesses that she has. 
				Being an immobile mage in an environment of increasingly more mobile bruisers and assassins, her skillshots are not reliable enough 
				to keep the enemy at bay. Furthermore her ultimate skill, Unleashed Power, is very difficult to balance due to it being a point and click 
				nuke. Because of pro play, Syndra's ultimate skill is very weak and heavily diminishes her lane phase. </p>
				
				<p >Throughout my time of playing the game, new mechanics have been introduced time and time again. In particular, Xayah's 
				Blade Caller ability has inspired me to make my own version of Syndra's w. I have also reworked Syndra's ultimate to increase it's versatility 
				and decrease the oppressive play style.</p>
				
				<p>Below is a small game that I have developed in Gamemaker Studios 2. I was not able to code enemy objects and have them 
				interact with Syndra or her abilities but I hope it is enough to communicate my vision for Syndra. I believe this is a good direction to take syndra, 
				helping her against mobile champions, allowing more outplay potential against her damage output and maintaining her overall identity.</p>

			<h2>Force of Will Rework (W)</h2>
			<p class = "description">My rework of Syndra's w pulls all existing spheres within a certain range towards her, damaging and slowing 
			all enemies it passes through and stops when in collision with her. The damage should be low medium base damage with a mediocre scaling 
			and decrease damage dealt with cosecutive hits. The reason I felt the need to make this change is to replace the old w which was slow and 
			hard to hit, making it a very clunky skillshot. Additionally, the new w can be used to slow enemies who are chasing Syndra, helping her 
			escape more mobile champions. The exchange of weak chasing potential for strong engage mitigation is a valuable trade in my opinion.</p>

			<h2>Unleashed Power rework (R) fast</h2>
			<p class = "description">My rework of Syndra's r fires 3 short ranged skill shots with a charge system akin to ahri's r. The skillshots 
			can be fired consecutively without cooldown in between. At the end of each cast, one sphere spawns at the end of animation.
			This preserves Syndra's identity of being able to nuke someone when landing the q-e.
			However, this new ultimate requires more commitment from the player and removes moments that feel unfair for the enemy such as flash + r</p>

			<h2>Unleashed Power rework (R) slow</h2>
			<p class = "description">My rework of Syndra's r fires 3 short ranged skill shots within a 5 second window similar to ahri's r. 
			The skillshots can be fired individually in different directions and damages all enemies it passes through. This new r allows for 
			more versatility especially when paired with her other skills. In terms of damage, this skill should have a high base damage due 
			to the possibility of missing it as well as helping her lane phase. It should have a low scaling to balance for the late game where the 
			w ability should be the main damage source.</p>

			<h2>Sphere duration refresh</h2>
			<p class = "description">Both the new w and r should refresh existing spheres' timers. In my game, the cooldowns for each skill is 
			set to the in game values at max rank.(q = 6s, w = 8s, e = 12s, r = 80s) Because each cast of the r refreshes and due to the fact 
			that the r duration is 5 seconds, the longest time a ball can currently be in existence is 6s + 6s + 5s + 6s + 6s = 29s. This is 
			achieved by q, w after 6s, r after 6s , r after 5s, and because the 8s cd of the w has passed, w for another 6 s. During this 29s 
			window, q can be cast 7 times. Including the 3 spheres spawned by the ultimate ability, 10 spheres can exist at the same time. 
			This may actually be a terrifyingly large amount so some numbers may need to be tweaked.</p>

			<h2>Scatter the Weak/Force of Will combo (E/W)</h2>
			<p class = "description">My rework of Syndra's w allows a powerful interaction of e and w being used in quick succession, allowing 
			for a damage follow up after landing a stun. This should be her staple burst combo pre 6 or while her ultimate is down.</p>

				<source src = "../syndra_videos/syndra_e_w.mp4" type = "video/mp4">

			</br>
			<h2>Force of Will/Scatter the Weak combo (W/E)</h2>
			<p class = "description">My rework of Syndra's w also allows her e to cancel the w's trajectory to earlier launch the spheres forward. 
			This should be used after setting up multiple spheres behind enemy lines either with multiple q's or the ultimate ability for 
			a strong aoe followed up by multiple stuns. This should be her main late game teamfighting combo.</p>

			</br>
			<h2>Full Combo</h2>
			<p class = "description">In this video, a glimpse of the full potential of syndra's kit is demonstrated. Both q and r should be used to 
			spawn spheres and set up for large aoe stuns with e and damage with w. In the current version of Syndra's ultimate ability a 
			strong emphasis on the idea that syndra's other abilities build up the damage of her final burst. I have preserved this identity 
			by shifting it into the w and to a lesser extent, the e. The build up of damage in her ultimate has now been shifted into her ultimate 
			building up the damage of the w. Additionally, her ultimate also builds up the area of effect of the e.</p>

		<div class = "conclusion">
			<p>According to Syndra's lore, she is a near omnipotent woman who has freed herself from the shackles and discrimination 
			of both her master and society. However, Syndra is increasingly less powerful and more trapped due to the rise in damage and mobility 
			in the current League of Legends environment. Syndra currently feels bogged down by her demanding skillshots and lack of mobility and damage. 
			While creating this passion project of mine, my goal was to make her feel like she has more options, giving the player more freedom of expression. 
			I also wanted to make her feel very powerful within her own space without making her too safe, thus discouraging bruiser and assassin type champions 
			without shutting them down.<p>
